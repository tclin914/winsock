# Winsock

http server + CGI in Windows
* You are asked to implement a simple http server which only provides the remote batch service, that is, it is the combination of 1st part and 2nd part.
* This server must be implemented by winsock.
* The client connection(i.e. the connections to your ras/rwg server) must be implemented in event driven model(WSAAsyncSelect).
* The functionality of the CGI part must be same with part1 CGI program.
